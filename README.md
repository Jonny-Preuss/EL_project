# Ensemble Learning Project
A project in our Ensemble Learning class. We were given data from an e-commerce website, and the target variable "units_sold". 

Furthermore, the goal was to test out several ensemble learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Adaboost and more.


**Structure**

- data: the main file ("summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_2020-08.csv") and two additional data files
- notebooks: the .ipynb file
